        <p>
            The arena of Institutional planning is enormously multifaceted. The functions and scales differ as per the requirements and the demands of the project. The space planning is (usually) generous as the number of occupants is usually large, in most case, with a high volume of space.
            <br>
            Since the features of institutions like schools, colleges, libraries, professional associations, and career courses are repetitive in functions, the designs thus formed are more disciplined and organized. <br>
            This brings down the planning skills to be competent enough in breaking the monotony using various design techniques like forms, textures, colors, and the introduction of new concepts without breaking the structural sequence. <br>
            Signage and graphics too play an important role. Their design sensibilities have constantly been evolving. Thus, they can show a continuous and visible transition from previous orthodox styles to a new revamped and contemporary feel that to their institutional projects.
